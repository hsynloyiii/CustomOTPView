# CustomOTPView
This is OTPView made by HsynLoyiii in order to use in your login flow or whereever need it.
It can use in IOS 15 and later in SwiftUI projects. I am working on to make it usable in IOS 13 and above.
Less Coding and waste time in your login OTP creation with this massive and flexible OTPView.
